## Outstanding Tasks
1. **Apify Integration** – Implement real scraping of top performing content from TikTok, Reels and Shorts using the Apify API. Connect scraped data to the ingestion endpoint in the backend.
2. **Audio & Video Analysis** – Build or integrate modules for speech-to-text transcription and video analysis to extract pacing, style, on-screen text and trending audio identifiers.
3. **Advanced Pattern Recognition** – Enhance the Generative Strategy Core’s pattern extraction logic using multi-modal AI models. Identify hooks, narrative arcs and visual formulas with higher accuracy.
4. **DALL‑E Integration** – Use the DALL‑E 3 API (or similar) to generate storyboard images for content packages. Handle API errors and rate limits.
5. **Authentication & Accounts** – Add user authentication and authorization via Supabase or Firebase. Support multi‑tenant access control.
6. **UI Implementation** – Build the Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS based on the v0.dev generated design. Include an input form for prompts and a display area for generated content packages.
7. **Testing & CI** – Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend. Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
8. **Observability** – Add structured logging, monitoring and error handling for each service. Implement alerts for critical failures.
9. **Documentation** – Expand `README.md` and `docs/` with setup instructions, API descriptions, architecture diagrams and usage examples.
10. **Deployment Configuration** – Prepare configuration files for deployment on Vercel (frontend) and Google Cloud Run (backend). Include environment variables and secret management.
11. **Project Management Updates** – Ensure `status.md` is kept up to date with progress, new tasks and links to issues or pull requests.
12. **Architecture Documentation** – Produce `docs/architecture.md` outlining system components and interactions.
13. **API Contract Documentation** – Create `docs/api_contracts.md` detailing request and response schemas for all endpoints.

## Completed
- Standardized backend API routes under `/api` and synced frontend calls.
- Added `.env.example` with required environment variable placeholders.
- Integrated ingestion providers (Apify, Playwright, Puppeteer) with strategy and generation placeholders.
- Frontend now offers provider selection, displays strategy patterns and renders generated scripts, storyboard images and notes.
- Supabase persistence added for ingested videos, extracted patterns and generated packages; dashboard surfaces stored IDs.
